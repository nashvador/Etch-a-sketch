## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a version of node that is at 16 or past it. If you do not go to this [website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and click on the version recommended for most users. Also make sure that you have an IDE like Visual Studio Code so that you can edit if you want to!

### Installing

In your terminal type these steps in to get the code running:

```
git clone https://github.com/nashvador/etch-a-sketch.git
cd etch-a-sketch
npm install
npm start
```

## Running Tests

Before running your tests make sure that you have all the prerequisites and have ran ```npm install``` prior to everything.

### Unit tests

The unit testing is done with Jest. To check these, type in ```npm run test```.

### Linter

To follow best practices, I used eslint to lint my code. If you are using a windows computer ```npm run lint``` should start up the linter. Then save and start with ```npm run lint``` in your terminal.
